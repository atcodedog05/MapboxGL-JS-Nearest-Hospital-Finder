# MapboxGL JS Nearest Hospital Finder

This Case Study is to analyse health and safety for the libraries in Lexington, KY. 

One important part of your preparedness mandate is to know which hospital is closest to each library in case there's an emergency at one of your facilities. 

This Interface is designed to analyse, calculate and display which hospital is the closest. 

Designed Using Turf.js and MapboxGL JS
